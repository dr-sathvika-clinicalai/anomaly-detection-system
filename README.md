# Anomaly Detection System using Statistics (OOP)

This project detects abnormal data points using statistical methods such as mean, variance, standard deviation, and z-score. The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and demonstrates how statistical anomaly detection works in real-world monitoring systems.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how statistical techniques such as mean, standard deviation, and z-score can be used to detect anomalies in data. The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles to simulate a simple real-world monitoring system.
